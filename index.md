Welcome to `Downtime Industries` a mostly fictional company that will help you know what to do and not do when writing software. We have several different repos and projects for you to look at. Feel free to scroll and contribute as you like!

If you disagree with some of our content you can feel free to shove it! The stuff we post are all really memes from our experience with "Industry" and we are far to jaded to actually care what people think. That being said if you notice something factually incorrect feel free to contribute a fix on our github repo: [downtime-industries/downtime-industries-website](https://github.com/downtime-industries/downtime-industries-website).
